            CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) allows you to create great-looking web pages, but how does it work under the hood? This article explains what CSS, what the basic syntax looks like, and how your browser applies CSS to HTML to style it.</p>

          <p class="section-description">Using CSS, you can control exactly how HTML elements look in the browser, presenting your documents to your users with whatever design and layout you like.</p>
          <ul class="list">
            <li class="list-element">A document is usually a text file structured using a markup language, most commonly HTML (these are termed HTML documents). You may also come across documents written in other markup languages such as SVG or XML. Where previously we've talked about web pages, an HTML document contains the web page's content and specifies its structure.</li>
            <li class="list_element">Presenting a document to a user means converting it into a form usable by your audience. Browsers like Firefox, Chrome, Safari, and Edge are designed to present documents visually, for example, on a computer screen, projector, mobile device, or printer. In a web context, this is generally referred to as rendering; we provided a simplified description of the process by which a web page is rendered in How browsers load websites.</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="section-description">CSS can be used for many purposes related to the look and feel of your web page. The most important are:</p>
          <ul class="list">
            <li class="list-element">Text styling, for example, for changing the color and size of headings and links.</li>
            <li class="list-element">Creating layouts, for example, turning a single column of text into a multiple-column layout.</li>
            <li class="list-element">Special effects such as animation.</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="section-description">The CSS language is organized into modules that contain related functionality. For example, take a look at the MDN reference pages for the Backgrounds and Borders module to find out what its purpose is and the properties and features it contains. In that module, you will also find a link to Specifications that defines the technology.</p>

        <article class="section-article">
          <p class="section-description">CSS is a rule-based language â€” you define rules by specifying groups of styles that should be applied to particular element or groups of elements on your web page.</p>
          <p class="section-description">For example, you might decide to style the main heading on your page as large red text. The following code shows a very simple CSS rule that would achieve this:</p>
          <code class="code-block">
            h1 { color: red; font-size: 2.5em;}
          </code>
          <ul class="list">
            <li class="list-element">In the above example, the CSS rule opens with a selector. This selects the HTML elements that we are going to style. In this case, we are styling level one headings (<code class="code-inline">h1</code>).</li>
            <li class="list-element">We then have a set of curly braces</li>
            <li class="list-element">The braces contain one or more declarations, which take the form of property and value pairs. We specify the property (for example, <code class="code-inline">color</code> in the above example) before the colon, and we specify the value of the property after the colon (red is the value being set for the color property)</li>
            <li class="list-element">This example contains two declarations, one for <code class="code-inline">color</code> and another for <code class="code-inline">font-size</code>.</li>
          </ul>
          <code class="code-block">
           h1 { color: red; font-size: 2.5em;}
          </code>
          <p class="section-description">You will find that you quickly learn some values, whereas others you will need to look up. The individual property pages on MDN give you a quick way to look up properties and their values.

        <article class="section-article">
          <p class="section-description">when you navigate to a web page, the browser first receives the HTML document containing the web page content and converts it to a DOM tree.</p>
          <p class="section-description">After that, any CSS rules found in the web page (either inserted directly in the HTML, or in referenced external <code class="code-inline">.css</code> files) are sorted into different "buckets", based on the different elements they will be applied to (as specified by their selectors). The CSS rules are then applied to the DOM tree, resulting in a render tree, which is then painted to the browser window.</p>
